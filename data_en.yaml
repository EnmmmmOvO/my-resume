          This project emulates an Airbnb-like web application, utilizing ReactJS as the front-end framework. It includes features such as booking management, search filters, and reviews. The entire project is developed in TypeScript with strict ESLint standards ensuring code quality and reliability. State management is handled via Context, routing through React Router, with Material UI for the UI framework, and component and UI testing conducted using Jest and Cypress.

          This project was a Kaggle competition entry that involved generating textual descriptions from input images. Our team deployed two models: CLIP + GPT-2 and Resnet + LSTM, with my responsibilities encompassing the latter's construction and training. The main logic involved image feature extraction by the ResNet-50 model, mapping these features to the input dimensions of GPT-2 via a linear layer, processing features through LSTM to generate preliminary text descriptions, which were further refined by GPT-2 to produce the final image descriptions.

          This project is a web application similar to Slack, built using VanillaJS as the front-end framework. It features user registration and login, channel creation, message sending, replies, editing, and deletion. Bootstrap 5 is employed as the UI framework.

          This project is a networking platform connecting professionals with projects. The front-end is developed using the React framework, while the backend utilizes Python with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, and SQLite3 for the database. Features implemented include business user registration, login, project posting, personal project viewing, applications, and reviews. I primarily handled backend development, database construction, ensured database consistency with SQLAlchemy, implemented backend interfaces with FastAPI, and user authentication with JWT.

          This project is my personal website, developed using React, TypeScript, and Material UI. It is currently incomplete, featuring an animated background using WebGL as well as various CSS animations. Future enhancements will include further website completion, with ongoing explorations in WebGL and Sass technologies.

          This project comprises two parts: a terminal-based chat room written in Java, utilizing sockets for message sending, receiving, and file transfer. The second part is a local area network file transfer application, also developed in Java with socket implementation, capable of transferring files and directories, including support for multiple file transfers. Currently, I am working on refactoring this project using Electron, React, TypeScript, and Material UI to ensure multi-platform usability and exploring the addition of resumable file transfers.
