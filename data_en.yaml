    project:
      - name: Member Card and Order Management System
        date: 2024.8 - Present
        des: !!md |
          Developed a comprehensive full-stack management system integrating member card creation and management with an order system. The system allows users to create, edit, and manage member cards while seamlessly combining these functionalities with order processing. Additionally, it features a member card printing function to convert digital designs into physical cards, enhancing user experience.
          The front end is implemented using Next.js and Vite, providing an efficient user interface and smooth interactions. The back end is built with FastAPI, and the database is managed using PostgreSQL. A stable server infrastructure was established to support multi-user concurrent access. Currently, the development of the order management module is in progress.

      - name: Signal E2E Chat
        date: 2024.9 - 2024.11
        source_code: https://github.com/EnmmmmOvO/e2ee
        des: !!md |
          Recreated the core functionalities of Signal's end-to-end encrypted chat, including key exchange, message encryption, and decryption, using Rust. Additionally, developed a simple and intuitive user interface with the egui library, enabling secure message sending and receiving.

      - name: Insect Pest Identification
        date: 2024.06 - 2024.08
        source_code: https://github.com/EnmmmmOvO/Information-Technology/blob/master/COMP9517/project/paper.pdf
        des: !!md |
          Implemented insect pest identification for 102 classes using Swin-T, VAE models, and a multi-model feature fusion approach. The latter utilized ViT, Swin-T, and ResNet to extract heatmaps, which were then fused using a multi-head attention model. The final classification was performed by a simple classifier, achieving high accuracy.

      - name: Airbnb (Web App)
        date: 2023.10 - 2023.11
        website: https://enmmmmovo.github.io/Airbnb/
        source_code: https://github.com/EnmmmmOvO/Airbnb
        des: !!md |
          Built a platform similar to Airbnb using ReactJS and TypeScript, including features such as booking management, search filters, and user reviews. Ensured code quality through strict ESLint rules, utilized Context for state management, React Router for routing, Material UI for UI enhancements, and conducted component and UI tests using JTest and Cypress.

      - name: Slackr (Web App)
        date: 2023.09 - 2023.10
        website: https://enmmmmovo.github.io/Slackr
        source_code: https://github.com/EnmmmmOvO/Slackr
        des: !!md |
          Developed a Slack-like instant messaging platform using VanillaJS, featuring registration, login, channel creation, message sending, editing, and deletion. Enhanced the user interface using Bootstrap 5 to provide a polished look and feel.

      - name: CONEX
        date: 2023.09 - 2023.11
        des: !!md |
          Created an online platform connecting professionals and projects. The front end was built with React, while the back end was implemented using Python, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy, with SQLite3 as the database. Implemented full functionalities for user registration, login, project posting, application, and commenting. Primarily responsible for back-end development, database design, and FastAPI interface creation, utilizing JWT for authentication.

      - name: Image to Prompt
        date: 2023.07 - 2023.08
        source_code: https://github.com/GATA-Chen/COMP9417_Project
        des: !!md |
          Participated in a Kaggle competition to generate descriptive text based on input images. The team used two models: CLIP + GPT2 and ResNet + LSTM. My role involved designing and training the ResNet + LSTM model, where ResNet-50 was used for feature extraction, followed by a linear layer to map features to GPT-2 input dimensions. The LSTM generated initial descriptions, which were refined by GPT-2 to produce the final output.
